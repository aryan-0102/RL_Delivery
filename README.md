## 🧭 Abstract

Efficient last-mile delivery routing remains a key challenge in urban logistics due to fluctuating traffic and time-sensitive demands.  
This repository implements and compares three algorithms — **Deep Q-Learning (DQN)**, **Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP)** solved via **2-Opt**, and the **Greedy Nearest Neighbor (NN)** — for **adaptive route planning** in a simulated city environment (Chandigarh, India).  

The model integrates **dynamic traffic simulation** using real-world OpenStreetMap (OSM) road data and evaluates GPU acceleration effects on DQN performance.  
Results show that while TSP remains superior under static conditions, DQN provides adaptive and scalable routing behavior under stochastic traffic, achieving up to **5× GPU speedup** in training and demonstrating the potential of reinforcement learning in **intelligent transportation systems (ITS)**.

## 🧩 Problem Formulation

The city road network is represented as a directed weighted graph:

$$
G = (V, E), \quad c_{ij} = \frac{L_{ij}}{100} \times \alpha_{ij}
$$

where $L_{ij}$ is edge length and $\alpha_{ij} \sim U(0.8, 2.0)$ models congestion.  
The goal is to minimize total travel time:

$$
\min_{\pi} T_{\text{total}} = \sum_{t=1}^{K} c_{p_{t-1}, p_t}
$$

subject to visiting each delivery node exactly once.

## 🧠 Algorithms Implemented

### A. Deep Q-Learning (DQN)
DQN learns an optimal policy $\pi^*(s) = \arg\max_a Q^*(s,a)$ through interaction with the environment.  
The Bellman optimality equation governs updates:

$$
Q^*(s,a) = \mathbb{E}[r_t + \gamma \max_{a'} Q^*(s',a')]
$$

Training minimizes the temporal difference (TD) loss:

$$
L(\theta) = \mathbb{E}\left[\big(r_t + \gamma \max_{a'} Q_{\theta^-}(s',a') - Q_\theta(s,a)\big)^2\right]
$$

**Features:**
- Experience replay for sample decorrelation  
- Soft target network updates $\theta^- \leftarrow \tau\theta + (1-\tau)\theta^-$  
- ε-greedy exploration with exponential decay

### B. Traveling Salesman Problem (2-Opt Heuristic)
A local search heuristic that iteratively swaps two edges if doing so reduces total distance:

$$
d_{i,i+1}+d_{j,j+1} > d_{i,j}+d_{i+1,j+1}
$$

This continues until convergence to a local minimum.  
Complexity: $O(n^2)$ per iteration.

---

### C. Greedy Nearest Neighbor (NN)
At each step, the next delivery $v_{t+1}$ is chosen as:

$$
v_{t+1} = \arg\min_{v \in U_t} d(v_t, v)
$$

where $U_t$ is the set of unvisited nodes.  
This yields fast yet suboptimal routes, useful for lightweight or baseline routing scenarios.
